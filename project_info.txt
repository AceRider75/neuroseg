Executive Summary & Problem Statement

Manual segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans is a significant bottleneck in the clinical
workflow. It is labor-intensive, subject to high inter-rater variability, and prone to fatigueinduced errors.
The Objective:
Engineer a deep learning system capable of ingesting raw, single-channel MRI slices and autonomously generating pixel-perfect segmentation masks of pre-genomic lower-grade gliomas
(LGG). The system must output a visual heatmap overlay and a quantitative surface area
estimate, delivered via a web-based interface for clinical review.
Scope of Work:
This is a Decision Support Tool, not a diagnostic device. The system aids the radiologist; it
does not replace them.

Dataset & Governance
• Source: LGG MRI Segmentation Dataset (Kaggle)
• Volume: ≈ 110 patients, ≈ 2,500 slices (.tif format).

2.1

Critical Data Engineering Constraints

Standard “random split” methods are strictly prohibited due to high risk of data leakage.
Subject-Level Splitting (Mandatory):
The dataset contains multiple slices per patient. Slices must be split by Patient ID. If slices
from Patient A appear in both Train and Test sets, the model effectively “memorizes” the
patient’s anatomy, rendering evaluation invalid.
Strict Data Augmentation:
Medical data is sparse; validation scores without augmentation are statistically insignificant.
• Required Transforms: Elastic deformation, Rotation (±15◦ ), Horizontal Flip, Brightness Jitter.
• Implementation Rule: Augmentations must be deterministic and paired. If the MRI
rotates 10◦ , the Ground Truth Mask must rotate exactly 10◦ .

Technical Requirements
Input/Output Specification
• Input: Single-channel Grayscale Image tensor (B, 1, H, W ).

• Target Metadata: Tumor Surface Area (reported in pixels, or mm2 if pixel spacing
metadata is extracted).
3.2

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
• Primary Metric: Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
• Target: > 0.85 on the held-out test set.
• Secondary Metrics: IoU (Intersection over Union), Sensitivity (Recall).
• Performance: Inference latency < 200ms per slice on standard CPU.

Execution Roadmap
Phase 1: Data Pipeline Infrastructure
• Task 1.1: Semantics & Visualization: Develop utility to overlay mask (Red channel,
α = 0.5) onto MRI. Verify mask logic: 0 = Healthy, 1 = Tumor.
• Task 1.2: Custom Dataloader: Implement a custom Dataset class. Engineering Check:
Verify paired transforms preserve spatial alignment.
• Task 1.3: Intensity Normalization: Implement Z-score normalization ( x−µ
σ ) or MinMax scaling per image.

Phase 2: Architecture Design (The U-Net)

Reference: Ronneberger et al., “U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation”.
• The Encoder: Stack of Conv2D → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool.
• The Decoder: UpSample → Concatenate → Conv2D.
• Skip Connections: Concatenate features from Encoder to Decoder to preserve spatial
details.

Phase 3: Model Training & Rigor

Task 3.1: Loss Function Engineering:
Do NOT use standard Cross-Entropy. Implement Combined Loss:
L = LBCE + LDice
Task 3.2: The Training Loop: Monitor Validation Dice Score. Implement EarlyStopping
and ReduceLROnPlateau.
Task 3.3: Baseline Benchmarking: Compare U-Net against a naive thresholding algorithm.
4.4

Phase 4: Deployment & Productization
• Post-Processing: Logits → Sigmoid → Threshold(0.5). Apply Morphological Opening
to remove noise.
• Quantitative Analysis: Calculate tumor area. Explicitly report “Area (pixels)” if
metadata is missing.
• Interface (Streamlit): Side-by-side comparison of Original vs. Predicted Overlay and
Confidence Scores.

• 3D Segmentation: Adapt architecture to 3D U-Net (V-Net).
• Explainability: Implement Grad-CAM to debug false positives.
